# Planwerk

**AI-powered development workflow engine that turns codebase analysis into shipped features**

---

*Structured planning · TDD execution · Automated code review*

</div>

## Overview

Planwerk bridges the gap between **"what should we build?"** and **"it's merged."** It uses AI to analyze your codebase, discover improvements, break them into user stories and tasks, guide implementation through strict TDD cycles, and manage the full lifecycle through to PR and merge.

## How it works

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <nobr>:mag: **Discover**</nobr> | Analyzes your codebase and surfaces actionable improvements, tech debt, and feature opportunities |
| <nobr>:world_map: **Plan**</nobr> | Breaks features into user stories, tasks, acceptance criteria, and test specifications using SPARC methodology |
| <nobr>:hammer_and_wrench: **Build**</nobr> | Guides implementation through a strict Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle |
| <nobr>:white_check_mark: **Review**</nobr> | Runs automated code review, integrates external feedback, and iterates until quality gates are met |
| <nobr>:rocket: **Ship**</nobr> | Creates PRs, monitors CI checks, addresses review comments, and merges — all from the CLI |
